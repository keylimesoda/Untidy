### UNTIDY-001 — Stabilize Wear emulator workflow under Fedora SELinux

- Priority: P0
- Type: task
- Area: tooling
- Owner: Tommy
- Labels: emulator, selinux, kvm, qa
- Spec: `docs/emulator-selinux-notes.md`

- Next: Run full lint/build/test after current emulator validation batch.
- Acceptance:
  - UI and playback service can coexist without duplicate DataStore crash
  - No AndroidRuntime DataStore exception in logcat during launch/service probes

- Next: Run after authenticated media controls are available.
- Acceptance:
  - Test notification/media controls with exported=true
  - Test whether exported=false breaks Wear/system media controls
  - If exported remains true, add controller/package validation or document accepted risk
